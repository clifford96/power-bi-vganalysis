# An Analysis on Video Games Sales throughout various Platforms/Consoles from 1980 - 2016
A simple Power BI dashboard to analyze video games sales for various platforms/consoles from 1980 - 2016.
(This is a basic project for me to further understand the capability and functionality of Power BI)

## Data Scource
Only a single CSV file is used and is obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kedokedokedo/vgsales)

## Aim
The aim of this Power BI dashboard is to understand the sales of video games and how it changes throughout the years as technologies improves.

## Objectives
1. Understand how the sales in NA, EU and JP compared to total Global sales and how much sales does each region contributes to the Global sales.
2. Determining the best/worst selling games, platforms and genres globally.
3. Determining the best selling games, platforms and genres in each region.

## Key Deliverables
1. NA sales has the highest contribution followed by EU, JP and Others.
2. The best selling game and platform are from Nintendo which is the Wii Sports and Nintendo Wii respectively.
3. Best selling genre globally is Action where NA and EU are the highest contributor.
4. Interesting take - Eventhough Sony PS2 is the highest selling platform, the top 5 selling games are all meant to be played in Nintendo platforms.
                    - This is probably cause the top Nintedo games are not meant to be played with a single console (ie. Pokemon is designed to be played on either GB/GBA/3DS while games like Wii 
                      Sports and Mario Kart Wii are designed to be played on a Wii.
5. NA sales alone contributes to 48%, almost half of the Global sales.
6. Both NA and EU shares the best selling game, genre and platform - Wii Sports, Action and PS2 respectively.
7. JP highest selling games are Pokemon, which aligns with their highest selling genre and platforms which are Role-Playing and Nintendo DS respectively.
